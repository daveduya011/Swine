                <p> 
                In addition to Ig's, colostrum contains high levels of protein, energy and Vitamin D that are vital to newborn pigs. Pigs are born with low body energy stores and, without Ig's from the sow's colostrum to protect them from environmental pathogens, newborn pigs are at risk for disease.

                <p>
                It has similar colostrum composition in terms of protein, fat, and lactose, when compared to cow's milk. Pigs with high-protein diets produce more milk compared to those on low-protein diets. It is also described as more gamy than goat's milk and seems more watery than cow's milk.

                * Pigs are monogastric animals and can utilize fibrous food only to a limited extent. Adult pigs can utilize fibrous food better than young stock.
                    <br/><br/>
                * Part of the protein in the diet of pigs should come from animal source such as fish, meat etc.
                    <br/><br/>
                * Pigs should be fed at regular intervals.
                    <br/><br/>
                * Fresh feed should be put only after removal of the previous feed from the feed trough.
                    <br/><br/>
                * Pig rearing based on commercial pig feed is not economical and hence feeding based on swill is recommended. On an average, pig requires 4-8 kg swill per day.
                    <br/><br/>
                * All categories of pigs can be given small quantity of fodder or may be sent to pasture.
                    <br/><br/>
                * Ad libitum feeding using an automatic feeder (which can be fabricated using 200 litre oil drum) may be practiced for weaned pigs to avoid post-weaning weight depression

                <p>
                A breeding boar requires 2-2.5 kg concentrate per 100 kg weight depending on the age, condition and breeding demand. Feed allowances should be so adjusted that the pig is neither fatty nor run down. Greens should be provided if kept indoors. Year-round pasture is excellent if it could be provided from the stand point of providing both the needed exercise and valuable nutrients.

                <div class="topic">Feeding of Female</div>
                <p>
                The demands resulting from pregnancy and need for conserving nutrients for ensuing lactation are accelerated during the later stage of pregnancy. The increased needs are for proteins, vitamins and minerals. 
                Mature sows gain 30-35 kg and gilts 40-45 kg during pregnancy. Feed should be so regulated that sows and gilts are never over fat or thin. Individual feeding is preferred. 
                Flushing is a practice of giving extra feed to sows and gilts from 1-2 weeks prior to mating and returns to normal feeding after mating.

                <p>
                The practice of self-feeding concentrates to young piglets in a separate enclosure away from their mother is known as creep feeding. Creep feed should be given when piglets are two weeks old. Each active and healthy piglet may consume about 10 kg feed before reaching the age of 8 weeks and two-third of this consumed between 6-8 weeks.

                <p>
                After farrowing, the navel cord is finished serving its purpose of carrying nutrients into the fetus and transferring waste products out. However, it can become a pathway for bacteria to enter the pig's body.

                <p>
                 Piglets are born with a pair of needle-sharp milk teeth at each of the front four corners of their jaws. In some circumstances, these teeth can damage the sow's teats when suckling and make them tender so that she may refuse to suckle her piglets.

                <div class="topic">3. Thermal requirement</div>
                <p>
                Pigs, like all animals, have an ability to live in a variety of thermal environments. Although pigs can adapt so some degree to different thermal environments, there is a cost to production associated with keeping them outside their comfort zone. During cold stress, pigs consume more feed to maintain their core body temperature (the temperature of their vital internal organs). The extra feed consumed is not used for body weight gain. On the other end of the scale, heat stress will reduce feed intake in the pig; production is reduced in the case of the lactating sow because of the reduction in milk production. It is also observed that pigs heat stressed in the growing phase are fatter. There are many factors, which influence the thermal environment of the pig.

                <div class="topic">4. Fostering</div>
                <p>
                319 Post-mortem surveys carried out to investigate high levels of piglet mortality have shown that over 30% of the piglets that die have no milk in their stomachs.
                    <br/><br/>
                The baby piglet is usually born in a fairly precarious state with limited energy reserves and with no acquired immunity. It undergoes a marked drop in environmental temperature from 39 degree Celsius (102 degree fahrenheit) often down to as low as 18 degree Celsius (65 degree fahrenheit). It has no fat insulation, very little hair and poor thermo-regulating mechanisms. It is therefore very sensitive to temperature changes and is heavily dependant on a high environmental temperature to maintain its own body temperature. It has a disparity in size to the sow of approximately 1:200, which is rather an unbalanced situation to be presented with at birth.

                <div class="topic">Baby Pig Management - Birth to Weaning</div>
                <p>
                Good care and management in the farrowing quarters has a major influence on the number of liveborn piglets that are weaned and on how well they perform in later stages of production. According to a 1995 survey of swine management practices in the United States, the average number of preweaning piglet deaths per litter on farms was .88 or 9.4% of those born alive. The two leading causes of preweaning deaths were laid on (48.7%) and starvation (20.5%). Other surveys have shown that over 50% of the deaths occur in the first two to three days of life.
                    <br/><br/>
                A successful caretaker understands that newborn piglets have certain physical characteristics which make them very reliant on proper management and care. Piglets are born without any antibody protection, their bodies contain fat energy for about one day of life, and they cannot regulate internal body temperature well until they are a few days old. 
                    <br/><br/>
                Piglets born alive fall into two broad categories-normal and disadvantaged. It is important to recognize the difference between normal and disadvantaged piglets so appropriate assistance can be provided. Normal piglets will be born quickly, get on their feet within a minute or two and be suckling in about 15 minutes. They move from teat to teat, taking a disproportionately large share of the most concentrated, immunoglobulin-rich colostrum. If the sow is a good mother and the farrowing environment is adequate, normal piglets thrive without much help from the caretaker.
                    <br/><br/>
                Disadvantaged piglets are ones weakened by the rigors of the birth process, are lightweight, have a congenital defect(s), are slow reaching the udder, or are chilled. Piglets weakened during the birth process include those that were oxygendeprived but not killed, "apparent" stillbirths that were revived, and piglets experiencing excessive physical trauma. The longer a sow takes to farrow the greater the chance these problems will appear. Lightweight piglets, especially those weighing less than 2.75lb at birth, are much less likely to survive to weaning than heavier piglets. Splayleg is a common congenital defect observed in disadvantaged piglets. Disadvantaged piglets are also slow in getting on their feet and to the udder. Their weakened state compromises their ability to compete with stronger, normal litter mates for access to teats during the first hours after birth. This reduces their intake of colostrum. Chilled piglets often experience a lower core body temperature which makes them susceptible to death. Often these piglets are seen shivering and huddled with litter mates, because their thermal requirements have not been met.

                <p>
                Research indicates that attending and assisting at farrowing can increase piglet survival and the number of pigs weaned. By being present at farrowing, one can quickly identify disadvantaged piglets and begin to assist them. Having many litters to supervise at one time (through batch farrowing or continuous farrowing in a multiple farrowing room complex) makes more efficient use of labor.

                <p>
                The farrowing quarters need to provide two different microclimates: a cool one for the sow (60-65 degree fahrenheit) and a hot one for the newborn piglets (85-95 degree fahrenheit the first few days, then decreased to the 70-80 degree fahrenheit range). To achieve this goal, maintain a room temperature at approximately 65-70 degree fahrenheit and provide zone heating for the litter.
                    <br/><br/>
                Provide zone heating in the farrowing quarters beginning 24 hours before expected farrowing. Heat lamps, heat pads, radiant heat devices, and hovers are common ways to provide zone heating in farrowing houses. The key is to have the supplemental heat directed behind the sow before farrowing and until farrowing is completed. If there is no extra heat present behind the sow during farrowing, position disadvantaged piglets in a heated area immediately after birth.

                <p>
                The first milk, colostrum, is rich in disease-preventing immunogloblins; the very first colostrum is the richest and best, because the quality of colostrum declines over time. Getting a good dose of colostrum, especially from the piglet's dam, is probably the single most important factor related to a piglet's survival and long-term health. Strong, early-born piglets get to the udder hours before their later-born litter mates and go from teat to teat taking the best colostrum. Thus, disadvantaged piglets often need assistance to obtain enough colostrum. Below are some methods to ensure piglets obtain an adequate dose of colostrum.

                <p>
                The lowest piglet mortality is observed in high birthweight litters with low within-litter piglet weight variation. Crossfostering is the most effective way to reduce within-litter piglet weight variation. The primary purposes of crossfostering is to reduce the weight variation within the litter and to more evenly match the number of piglets with the sow's ability to raise them (determined by the number of functional teats).

                Processing piglets includes clipping teeth, clipping and treating the umbilical cord, iron administration, tail docking, identification, treating splaylegged piglets, providing supplemental nutrients, and castration. These skills can be performed in different ways and in the sequence of personal preference. Some producers elect not to perform all these procedures, or they prefer to delay some of them for three to four days to reduce stress on the very fragile one-day-old piglet.
