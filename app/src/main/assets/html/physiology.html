                <p>
                Puberty in gilts is usually defined as the time at which first estrus occurs. Depending on breed, management and season of the year this may occur around 5 to 6 months of age. Estrus or heat may be defined as a period of ovulation during which the female will accept the male. In practice, however, the ultimate indicator of what is regularly referred to as standing heat is the gilt or sow's immobilization in response to back pressure. It is well known in the swine industry that early attainment of puberty is a key factor in minimizing costs associated with rearing replacement gilts.

                <p>
                Current and emerging concepts of follicle growth and ovulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian interactions, corpus luteum function and estrous cycle regulation in cattle, sheep and swine are reviewed. Follicles grow, regress and are replaced by other large follicles continuously throughout the cycle; intra-ovarian factors appear to play important roles in this process.

                <p>
                In many species the appearance of oestrus is sufficient to ensure that the time of ejaculation, sperm transport and capacitation are balanced with the time of ovulation. In the pig these phenomena vary considerably and require additional regulatory mechanisms which are partly explained by seminal components. Boar semen is rich in oestrogens (up to 11.5 micrograms/ejaculate)

                <p>
                The gestation period for a female potbellied pig is 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days or 112 to 115 days. You will know your pig is pregnant if she does not come back into estrus/heat at her normal time. If you are not sure how far along your pig is, you may want to have the vet perform an ultrasound.

                As she gets closer to having the babies, her belly will get bigger and her teats may drag the ground. This is fine as it will toughen them up. You see, piglets have very sharp teeth. At about 4-5 days before birth, her vulva will begin to swell. You will also see a milk line form along the teats, and she will start getting restless and nesting. If there are other pigs or animals around, you will want to move her into her own pen and have a farrowing box ready for the piglets.
